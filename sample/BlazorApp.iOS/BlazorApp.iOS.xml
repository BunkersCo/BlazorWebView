            The UIApplicationDelegate for the application. This class is responsible for launching the
            User Interface of the application, as well as listening (and optionally responding) to application events from iOS.

            Called when the user discards a scene session.
            If any sessions were discarded while the application was not running, this will be called shortly after `FinishedLaunching`.
            Use this method to release any resources that were specific to the discarded scenes, as they will not return.

            <summary>
            Use this method to optionally configure and attach the UIWindow `window` to the provided UIWindowScene `scene`.
            If using a storyboard, the `window` property will automatically be initialized and attached to the scene.
            This delegate does not imply the connecting scene or session are new (see UIApplicationDelegate `GetConfiguration` instead).

            <summary>
            Called as the scene is being released by the system.
            This occurs shortly after the scene enters the background, or when its session is discarded.
            Release any resources associated with this scene that can be re-created the next time the scene connects.
            The scene may re-connect later, as its session was not neccessarily discarded (see UIApplicationDelegate `DidDiscardSceneSessions` instead).

            <summary>
            Called when the scene has moved from an inactive state to an active state.
            Use this method to restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) when the scene was inactive.

            <summary>
            Called when the scene will move from an active state to an inactive state.
            This may occur due to temporary interruptions (ex. an incoming phone call).

            <summary>
            Called as the scene transitions from the foreground to the background.
            Use this method to save data, release shared resources, and store enough scene-specific state information
            to restore the scene back to its current state.
